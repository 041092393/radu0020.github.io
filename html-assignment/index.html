            <h2>About Me</h2>
               
                <p>
                Hi, my name is Jessica Radul and I am from a small northern town called White River, in Ontario, Canada. My hometown is known for being the birth place if Disney's beloved <em>Winnie the Pooh.</em> The actual black bear, that was bought from a trapper, was born in the area and sold to Captain Colebourn. I won't go into much detail about that but, we do have a festival every year in which the locals refer to as "pooh fest". A rather odd statement to be heard from outsiders.

                <p>Growing up, I spent many hours at my grandmothers house, where art was first introduced to me. My grandmother was an accomplished painter in her own right, and taught me much of what she knows. While we spent much time tending to the garden, cooking, hanging clothes on the line to dry or watching "Murder she wrote", I found my creative voice, and my hard working attitude, much due to time spent with her. </p>

                <P>
                    Throughout my highschool career it became apparent to my teachers that I had a nack for the arts, and was given the opportunity to do a mural in our local highschool, which still can be seen there to this day. At that time I had no idea what Graphic Design was, and my english teacher, Mr. Larret approached me one day and told me that I should take that program. After much research I found that it was an appropriate match for my skills and I was off to college. Eventually graduating from <abbr title="Visual College of Art and Designr">VCAD</abbr> on September 30<sup>th</sup> 2022.
                </P>
